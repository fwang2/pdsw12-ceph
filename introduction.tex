\section{Introduction}

National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS), in collaboration with
Inktank Inc, prepared this performance and scalability study of
Ceph file system. Ceph originated from Sage Weil's PhD research
at UC Santa Cruz around 2007 and it was designed to be a reliable, scalable
fault-tolerant parallel file system. Inktank is now the major developer behind
the open-source parallel file system to sheperd its development and provide
commercial support.

In comparison to other parallel file systems, Ceph has a number of distinctive
features:

\begin{itemize}
 
\item Ceph has an intelligent and powerful data placement mechanism, known as
  CRUSH. The CRUSH algorithm allows a client to pre-calculate object
  placement and layout while taking into consideration of failure domains and
  hierarchical storage tiers.
  
\item From the start, Ceph's design anticipated managing metadata and the name space
  with a cluster of metadata servers. It utilized a dynamic subtree partitioning
  strategy to continuously adapt metadata distribution to current demands.

\item Ceph's design assumes that the system is composed of unreliable
components; fault-detection and fault-tolerance (e.g., replication) are the
norm rather than the exception. This is in line with the expectations and
future directions of Exascale computing.

\item Ceph is built on top of a unified object management layer,
\texttt{RADOS}. Both metadata and the file data can take advantage of this
uniformity.

\item Most of the Ceph processes reside in user-space. Generally speaking, this makes the
system easier to debug and maintain. The client-side support has long been
integrated into Linux mainline kernel, which eases the deployment and out-of-box
experience.

\end{itemize}


As part of this effort, we set up a dedicated testbed within NCCS for the Ceph
file system evaluation. The goal of our study is to investigate the
feasibility of using the Ceph for our future HPC storage deployment.  This
paper presents our experience, results, and observations. While evaluating
our results, please keep in mind that Ceph is still a relatively
\textit{young} parallel file system and its code base is changing rapidly. In
between releases, we often experienced different stability and performance
outcomes.  We will try to make clear in the writing when such changes occurred.

This paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:testbed} gives an
overview on our general test and evaluation methodology as well as testbed
environment; Following it, Section~\ref{sec:baseline} establishes the baseline
performance and expectations for all critical components on the data path;
Section~\ref{sec:ceph-initial} discusses our early results bottom up: from
middle tier RADOS object layer to the file system-level. Then in
Section~\ref{sec:ceph-tuning} we highlight the investigative and tuning
effort, we compare results before and after, and how the process eventually
bring the system performance to a respectable state.
Section~\ref{sec:ceph-meta} present our preliminary findings on Ceph's
metadata performance. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes our
findings, observations, and future works.
