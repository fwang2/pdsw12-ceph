Ceph is designed to be a reliable and scalable fault tolerant parallel file
system with a number of intriguing features. In collaboration with its major
developer, Inktank Inc, we studied the feasibility of using Ceph for future
HPC storage deployment. This paper presents our experiments, results and
observations from mostly performance and scalability perspective. Our work
made two unique contributions. First, this evaluation is performed under a
realistic setup using state-of-the-art backend storage (Data Direct Network's
SFA10K),  although typical in large-scale HPC environment, but atypical for
average commercial off-the-shelf setup.  Second, our path of investigation,
tuning efforts, and findings made a direct contribution to Ceph's development,
it should also benefit community at large. Throughout the evaluation, we can
see that Ceph is under fast-paced development and maturing with great promise.
